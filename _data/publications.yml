    description: "Vision transformers (ViTs) are very popular in computer vision because it's relatively easy to get good performance out of pretrained models. 
However, ViTs face challenges in efficiently modeling both long-range and short-range spatial interactions. 
GC ViT enhances parameter and compute efficiency in computer vision by combining global and local self-attention to model 
both long and short-range spatial interactions without the need for expensive operations. It also tackles ViTs' inductive 
bias issue using modified fused inverted residual blocks. 
In this project, a two-stage pipeline is proposed to classify cervical vertebrae and detect fractures. Firstly, the Global Context Vision Transformer 
is applied to cervical spine fracture CT images to classify the vertebrae. Its performance is then compared to other deep learning methods, including ResNet,
Convnext, Vision Transformer, and Swin Transformer. In the second stage, the YOLOv8 Algorithm is implemented to detect fractures."
