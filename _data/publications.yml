    description: "Vision transformers (ViTs) are very popular in computer vision because it's relatively easy to get good performance out of pretrained models. 
                  However, ViTs face challenges in efficiently modeling both long-range and short-range spatial interactions. 
                  GC ViT enhances parameter and compute efficiency in computer vision by combining global and local self-attention to model 
                  both long and short-range spatial interactions without the need for expensive operations. It also tackles ViTs' inductive 
                  bias issue using modified fused inverted residual blocks. 
                  In this project, a two-stage pipeline is proposed to classify cervical spine vertebrae and detect fractures. Firstly, 
                  a multi-input network is developed, utilizing both image data and image metadata. The network is trained using the
                  Global Context Vision Transformer for the analysis of cervical spine fracture CT images. Its performance is then compared to other 
                  deep learning methods, including ResNet, Convnext, Vision Transformer, and Swin Transformer. In the second stage, the YOLOv8 Algorithm 
                  is implemented to detect fractures."
