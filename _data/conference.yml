    description: "This paper introduces deep learning approaches for discerning images captured through the Optical Coherence Tomography technique, 
    distinguishing between normal eye images and those associated with three eye-related conditions including Diabetic Macular Edema (DME), Choroidal neovascularization (CNV),
    and DURSEN. Given the promising outcomes of utilizing transformers in vision tasks, the primary objective of this study is to explore 
    the use of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) in certain classification scenarios. To accomplish this goal, a patch extraction process 
    is applied to the images. Subsequently, the extracted patches are treated as sequences, and bidirectional Recurrent Neural Networks are employed for image classification.
    Additionally, four pre-trained models—VGG16, ResNet152V2, NasnetMobile, and Densenet169—along with a vision transformer model, are implemented and compared. 
    The results indicate that the proposed model attains a test accuracy of 99.38%, surpassing the performance of other models."
