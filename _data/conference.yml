    description: "This paper introduces deep learning approaches for discerning images captured through the Optical Coherence Tomography technique, 
    distinguishing between normal eye images and those associated with three eye-related conditions including Diabetic Macular Edema (DME), Choroidal neovascularization (CNV),
    and DURSEN. Given the promising outcomes of utilizing transformers in vision tasks, the primary objective of this study is to explore 
    the use of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) in certain classification scenarios. To accomplish this goal, a patch extraction process 
    is applied to the images. Subsequently, the extracted patches are treated as sequences, and bidirectional Recurrent Neural Networks are employed for image classification.
    Additionally, four pre-trained models—VGG16, ResNet152V2, NasnetMobile, and Densenet169—along with a vision transformer model, are implemented and compared. 
    The results indicate that the proposed model attains a test accuracy of 99.38%, surpassing the performance of other models."

    description: "Pedestrian safety is of utmost importance in developing Autonomous Vehicles (AVs).
    Accurate detection of pedestrians could be a challenging task to provide safe vehicle and pedestrian interaction. This work incorporates two deep
    learning-based models YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 aiming at safe interaction between AVs and pedestrians specifically in complex and high-density environments"

  - title: Design and Fabrication of an Inflatable Soft Robot for Enhancing Foot Drop Rehabilitation
    authors:Gharibkhanian, A., <strong>Nejad, R. B.</strong>, Ghafarirad, H., & Zareinejad, M

    description: "Foot drop is characterized by the inability to raise the front of the foot, resulting from a weakening of the dorsiflexor muscles. This condition can cause an unsteady and painful
    walking gait, increasing the risk of tripping and potential falls.The traditional method of managing foot drop involves using an ankle-foot orthosis. However, wearable robots provide a
    promising alternative for muscle injury rehabilitation. This paper presents a soft wearable rehabilitation robot equipped with
    pneumatic fiber actuators designed to assist dorsiflexor muscles.Unlike conventional medical orthoses, this soft ankle orthosis
    preserves natural ankle motion, facilitating a more natural gait recovery for patients. With a maximum force output of 150 Newtons and a lightweight design of just 82 grams, it offers
    comfortable wear, similar to regular clothing."
