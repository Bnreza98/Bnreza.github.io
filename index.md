## About Me

I am a graduate student with a background in mechanical engineering and mechatronics engineering. I am particularly interested in using deep learning, computer vision, and control systems to develop innovative solutions in healthcare and robotics.

My Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering from Amirkabir University of Technology (Tehran Polytechnique) focused on manufacturing technologies. For my bachelor's thesis, I collaborated on a team that designed and fabricated an inflatable soft exoskeleton to assist patients with foot drop, supervised by Dr. Mohammad Zareinejad and Hamed Ghafarrirad at the New Technologies Research Center (NTRC).

Currently pursuing a Master of Science in Mechatronics Engineering at K.N.Toosi University of Technology, my master's thesis explores driver attention, specifically the impact of billboards on driver attention using control theory perspective and data-driven methods, particularly deep learning. In addition to academic pursuits, experience has been gained through part-time roles at Nasir Driving Simulator, contributing to the development of driving training simulators and driving monitoring systems. Work has also involved driver behavior recognition using vehicle data to identify aggressive driving patterns. Participation in research projects has also provided exposure to deep learning methods for medical image classification.

In addition to my academic pursuits, I have gained valuable experience through part-time roles at Nasir Driving Simulator. This includes contributing to the development of driving training simulators and driving monitoring systems, where my focus has been on driving behaviour recognition. I have also participated in research projects involving deep learning methods for medical image classification. 

Overall, I employ deep learning and computer vision methods, along with control systems, to model human sensory functions. My focus extends to areas such as medical imaging and rehabilitation robotics, aiming to enhance the quality of life and alleviate the burden of patient care. I am hopeful that my research will effectively contribute to these goals.
