## About Me

I am a graduate student with a background in mechanical engineering and mechatronics engineering. I am particularly interested in using deep learning, computer vision, and control systems to develop innovative solutions in healthcare and robotics.

I earned my Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering from Amirkabir University of Technology (Tehran Polytechnique), where I focused on manufacturing technologies. During my bachelor's thesis, I collaborated with a team to design and fabricate an inflatable soft exoskeleton to assist patients with foot drop. This project was conducted at the New Technologies Research Center (NTRC) under the supervision of Dr. Mohammad Zareinejad and Hamed Ghafarrirad.

Currently, I am pursuing my Master of Science in Mechatronics Engineering at K.N.Toosi University of Technology. My master's thesis focuses on driver attention, specifically exploring the impact of billboards on driver attention using control theory and data-driven methods, particularly deep learning.

In addition to my academic pursuits, I have gained valuable experience through part-time roles at Nasir Driving Simulator. I have contributed to the development of driving training simulators and driving monitoring systems that track driver gaze and head movements. I have also worked on driver behavior recognition using vehicle data to identify aggressive driving patterns.
I have also participated in research projects involving deep learning methods for medical image classification. 

Overall, in utilizing deep learning and computer vision methods as well as control systems to model human sensory, medical imaging and rehabilitation robotics to improve the quality if life and lower the burden of patient care. I hope my research will be effective for this goal.
